SELECT s.Score, COUNT(s2.score) AS 'Rank'
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Score FROM Scores) s2, Scores s
WHERE s2.Score >= s.Score 
GROUP BY s.Id

-- Idea: Perform a cross join with distinct scores in Scores with Scores table where s.Score <= s2.Score. 
-- We perform a group by to compute the rank and order by score in descending at the end.
